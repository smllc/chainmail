# Chainmail

// 1-1-2018

Chainmail is a blockchain-secured transaction solution using Stamps as the cryptocurrency for payment that will offer never before possible communications for the medical and financial industries (as well as the consumer sector).

We plan to expose our technology via open-sourced modules and an easy-to-use API for such uses as 100% secure email messages, Smart Contracts, HIPPA-Compliancy, legal document transfers, chain-of-ownership to the atomic level, micro-payments, and more.

Be on the lookout for changes to this page as we are launching soon! If you'd like to join us, send an email to info@chainmail.global and breifly tell us why you want to join Chainmail and what you bring to our already talented team of designers, architects, developers, and Subject Matter Experts.
