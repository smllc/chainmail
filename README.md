# Chainmail

// 1-1-2018

Chainmail is a blockchain-secured transaction solution using Stamps as the cryptocurrency for payment. Our solution will offer never before possible communications for the medical and financial industries (as well as the consumer sector).

We plan to integrate our technology for such uses as 100% secure email messages, Smart Contracts, HIPPA-Compliancy, legal document transfers, chain-of-ownership to the atomic level, micro-payments, and more.

Be on the lookout for changes as we are launching soon! If you'd like to join us, send an email and tell us why you want to join and what you bring to our already talented table of designers, architects, developers and subject matter experts.
